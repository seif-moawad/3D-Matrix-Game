ntroduction

Welcome to the 3D Matrix Game! This project is a 3D game developed using C#, where a cube moves within a matrix of squares. The objective of the game is to guide the cube through the matrix, avoiding obstacles and reaching the last row to win. However, if the cube encounters a circle within the matrix, it will fall down and result in a loss. Additionally, exceeding the limits in the right and left directions will also cause the cube to fall and result in a game over. Let's explore the key features and mechanics of this exciting game.
Game Mechanics

    The game is set in a matrix of squares, forming a 3D grid.
    The player controls a cube, which can move in all directions within the matrix.
    The cube's objective is to reach the last row of the matrix to win the game.
    Obstacles in the form of circles are randomly placed within the matrix.
    If the cube encounters a circle, it will fall down and the game will be lost.
    The cube's movement is limited by the boundaries of the matrix in the right and left directions.
    If the cube exceeds these limits, it will fall and result in a game over.

Controls

    Use the arrow keys or WASD keys to control the cube's movement.
    Press the up arrow key or the W key to move the cube upward.
    Press the down arrow key or the S key to move the cube downward.
    Press the left arrow key or the A key to move the cube to the left.
    Press the right arrow key or the D key to move the cube to the right.

Game Over and Victory

    The game ends in a loss if the cube encounters a circle within the matrix or exceeds the limits in the right and left directions.
    The game ends in a victory if the cube successfully reaches the last row of the matrix.
